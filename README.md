= Example of creating and using a Neural Network in Ruby
This example will show how to implement a simple neural network for classification in Ruby using ruby-fann.

For more information about this network see the blog post [Implementing Simple Classification using a Neural Network in Ruby](http://www.practicalai.io/implementing-simple-classification-using-neural-network-in-ruby/).
